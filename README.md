Automated Plant Disease Detection System with Progression Monitoring
A real-time plant health monitoring system built to run on a Raspberry Pi 5. This project uses a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to not only detect plant diseases but also to estimate their severity and track their progression over time, providing actionable insights for early intervention.

üåü Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Utilizes a Raspberry Pi camera to provide a live video feed with disease classifications overlaid.

Severity Estimation: The CNN model is trained to classify the stage of a disease (e.g., "Early Stage," "Advanced Stage"), offering more detail than a simple diagnosis.

Progression Tracking: Detections are automatically logged with a timestamp to a local SQLite database. The system displays a recent history on-screen, allowing users to visually monitor if a plant's health is improving or declining.

High Accuracy: The deployed CNN model achieves an accuracy of 88% in classifying different plant diseases and their stages.

Edge Computing: All processing is done directly on the Raspberry Pi 5, making it a standalone and portable solution that doesn't require a constant internet connection.

Early Intervention: By providing timely and detailed health data, this system has the potential to reduce crop yield loss by up to 30%.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The system follows a continuous loop:

Image Capture: The Raspberry Pi's camera captures a live video frame.

Preprocessing: The captured image is resized and normalized to match the input requirements of the neural network.

Inference: The processed image is fed into the pre-trained TensorFlow Lite CNN model, which predicts the disease, severity, and a confidence score.

Data Logging: The prediction result is saved with the current timestamp into a local SQLite database on the device.

Visualization: The live video feed is displayed on-screen. The current diagnosis and the last 3 historical logs are overlaid on the frame, providing an immediate visual report of the plant's health progression.

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi 5 (A Raspberry Pi 4 should also work, but performance may be slower)

Raspberry Pi Camera Module (v2 or higher recommended)

MicroSD Card (16GB or larger, Class 10)

Power Supply for Raspberry Pi

Monitor with HDMI input (for setup and viewing the output)

üíæ Software & Setup
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS
Start by installing the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended) on your microSD card.

2. Install Dependencies
Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install OpenCV and its dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y python3-opencv libopencv-dev

# Install Picamera2 library
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2

# Install TensorFlow Lite runtime

# Visit the TensorFlow website for the latest official instructions.
python3 -m pip install tflite-runtime

3. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

git clone [https://github.com/NeuralX-CV/AgriShield.git](https://github.com/NeuralX-CV/AgriShield.git)
cd plant-disease-detection

üß† Model Training
The core of this project is the custom-trained model. To train your own, you will need a powerful computer (a GPU is highly recommended).

Prepare a Dataset: Collect and organize images of plant leaves into directories. The directory names should follow the format Plant___Disease___Severity, for example:

Tomato___Late_blight___Early

Tomato___Late_blight___Advanced

Tomato___healthy

Install TensorFlow: On your training machine, install the full TensorFlow library: pip install tensorflow.

Run the Training Script: Modify the DATA_DIR variable in train_plant_model.py to point to your dataset directory, then run the script:

python train_plant_model.py

This will generate two crucial files: plant_disease_model.tflite and plant_disease_labels.txt.

Transfer to Pi: Copy these two generated files to the project directory on your Raspberry Pi.

üöÄ Usage
With the hardware set up, dependencies installed, and the model files in place, simply run the main detection script from the terminal:

python plant_disease_detection.py

Point the camera at a plant leaf. A window will appear showing the live feed with the current diagnosis and recent history. Press 'q' on your keyboard to quit the application.

üí° Future Work
Environmental Sensors: Integrate temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors (e.g., DHT22) to correlate environmental conditions with disease outbreaks.

Web Interface: Create a web dashboard to view the detection log and progression graphs remotely.

Pest Detection: Expand the model into an object detection model (like YOLO) to identify and count common pests.

Automated Alerts: Implement an alerting system (e.g., email or push notifications) when a severe disease is detected.
